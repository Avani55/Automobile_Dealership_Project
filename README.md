Automobile Dealership Project

This Java project simulates an automobile dealership system where users can view a collection of cars and purchase them. The backend logic is implemented using object-oriented principles with classes such as Car and Dealership. Each car has properties like make, price, year, color, and parts, while the dealership manages a collection of cars, allowing users to browse and purchase them interactively.

Features:

Car objects with detailed attributes such as make, price, year, color, and parts.
A dealership that holds a collection of cars, which can be displayed to the user.
A selling mechanism where the user can select a car from the dealership and "purchase" it.
Technologies Used:

Java
How to Use:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Run the Main.java file to interact with the automobile dealership system.
The system will prompt you to select a car from a list.
Upon selecting a car, the system will simulate the purchase and display a message.
